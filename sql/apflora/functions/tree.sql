-- idea: build tree in a psql function
-- Query each branch in separate with clause
-- filter each branch by passed in filter criteria
-- every row gets sort string
-- union all branches
-- sort rows by sort string
--
-- filter criteria:
-- pass in array of composite types (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/rowtypes.html)
-- composite type describes filter criteria:
-- - branch (not table: ek/ekf)
-- - field
-- - comparator
-- - value
-- - type (to cast the value correctly)
-- build sql query string using these filter criteria
-- This is same principle used in kapla/personal
-- For example see: https://stackoverflow.com/a/8146245/712005
-- to prevent injection, see: https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/49718/51861
--
-- How to deal with or-queries?
-- Define the function as variadic and loop through all the composite type arrays
-- which are passed in as last arguments

--
-- cons:
-- - lots of work to build (but: work needed for or-filters anyway)
-- - much more processing server side (but: peaks are comparatively reduced, see pros)
-- - rows fetched are not added to table cache of apollo
-- - passing filter criteria adds to data transfered (but: that happens in graphql too)
-- - sort string: dangerous. Fill each entry to equal lengths?
--
-- pros:
-- - much less data transfered?
-- - sql allows more powerfull queries
-- - much less processing client side
-- - easier to change to offline client side filtering later?
-- - more server side base processing makes peaks less extreme
